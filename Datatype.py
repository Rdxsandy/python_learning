# integer float boolean 
# print(100000)
# print(1e308) this is a valid integer but 1e309 is inf..
#float has also very big range..

# in boolean we have true false 
# print(True) print(False)
# it has also complex number print(5+gj)
# print(5+6j)
# print((5+6j)*(3+2j)) =(3+28j)
# print((2+2j)/(3+1j))=(0.7999999999999999+0.4j)
# it is also doing multipilication and devision of complext number
# we can write string in single inverted '' or "" or """string """ every one has own usecase

# another data types are list tuple and sets
# list are nothing but the array in java
# list =[]=> [1,2,"apple",'mango']
# tuple are ... (1,2,3,4)
#set are .... {1,2,3,4}
# dict we store in it key value pair ....
# we can search in dictionary effectively.....
# we have also thir type user define type and we would lern this in object oriented programming
