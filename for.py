# lets learn about the for loop of python

#  there is range function

# print(list(range(15)))=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
# print(list(range(5,10)))=[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# print(list(range(50,5,-5)))= [50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10]
# print(list(range(1,50,5)))=[1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31, 36, 41, 46]

# for i in range(1,10):
#     print(i)
#  output-
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9

# for i in range(1, 5):
#     for j in range(1, 5):
#         print(i*j, end=' ')
#     print()
# output
# 1 2 3 4 
# 2 4 6 8 
# 3 6 9 12
# 4 8 12 16

# in python for loop there is no termination condition its simply iterate on sequence
# sequence may be stirng and list and tuple 

# for i in "kolkata":
#     print(i,end=' ')

# output = k o l k a t a
