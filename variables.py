# in python we do not need to define the datatype of varible bcoz it is dynamicaly typed language
# no need to declare variable before use 
# a ='nitish'
# b = 5
# static typing in which we decide the datatype at compile time
# python also support dynamic binding in 

# what is dynamic binding it is basically suppose i assinged a ='sundeep' after that i can assing a=5 it hold ture in python 
# a,b,c,d=0,0,0,0
# print(a,b,c,d)= 0 0 0 0

# a=b=c=d=7
# print(a,b,c,d) = 7 7 7 7
